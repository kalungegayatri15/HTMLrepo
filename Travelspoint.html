<p align="left">Do you have plans to travel around the world?
Do you have <b>big dreams</b> running through your head about traveling around the <b>world</b>? Is long-term travel something you are considering but don’t know where to start?

Planning an around the world trip can be an overwhelming experience. From figuring out your budget to designing your itinerary to packing your bags, there are so many things to consider.

We know what it is like. It’s exciting and terrifying and awesome all at the same time. It took us four years of discussion just to even make the decision to travel around the world. We know what a hard decision it can be.

From the planning phase to what it’s like to be on the road and then what it is like to finally come home, we have lots of information to share with you.</p>
